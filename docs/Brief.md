# Web Developer Coding Test

## Summary

This exercise is designed to demonstrate your web development skills.
Write a simple dashboard using data from a publicly available API described below in [Demo API Server setup](#3), following the design (BBC_code_challenge_design.png) to build the UI.
We are looking for a solution that is maintainable, well organised and has potential to be easily extended.

Please achieve what is possible in the time you have. We would prefer a high quality application to an extensive application where quality has been sacrificed.

## Requirements

* You MUST use JavaScript, CSS and HTML to do this.
* The user interface should follow the design given in BBC_code_challenge_design.png, you can use any CSS framework to make your life easier.

## Demo API Server setup

Inside the `api/` folder:

* Run `npm install`
* Run `node index.js`

You can then access the server at http://localhost:3001 which shows the endpoints available.

## What we are looking for

* High quality, well structured, maintainable code.
* Test cases for your Javascript code.
* Clean visual design.
* (optional) Use of JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, ember e.t.c) 
* (optional) Use of JavaScript build tools (babel, Webpack, Grunt etc.) 
* (optional) Use of SASS, LESS.
* P.S. Icons have been taken from FontAwesome, that might help
